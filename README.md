# Kai Final
This is Kailong's Final project of Spring 2018.  
This is used for both Data Wrangling and Convex Optimization courses.  

## Apr. 14th 2018  
Update Download Import Clean and Merge.  
Dataset is built well.  

## Apr. 29th 2018  
If you run "Download and Import.R" and "Clean and Merge.R" you will get 3.2GB dataset.  
The dataset contains citibike data between 2013-07-01 and 2017-12-31.  
If your computer only has 8GB RAM, I recommend use test.RData to see result, which only has data between 
2017-06-01 and 2017-12-31. Otherwise, your computer is supposed to boom shakalaka~
